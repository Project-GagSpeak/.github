This project originally began as a way to help apply my programming skills from collage towards causes beyond schoolwork from the request of some friends, but quickly evolved into a passion project that helped me grow in my understanding of programming, kept my skills strengthened, and continuously presented me with new challanges to overcome.

While the subject matter of BDSM may be a niche area of choice, I would not be as talented of a programmer as I am now without this project, and for that I have no regrets.
In its truest form, this is one major passion project, distributed as a free open-source addon for everyone else to enjoy and use. No paywalls, no closed source secrets, no BS.

Remember you are loved and cared for, and we are unique because we are different. It's what makes you special~
